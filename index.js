/*
First Task :
You are asked to write an algorithm that fulfills the following: 

Name: Dot product
Description:
Write a function, called dot_product which calculates in the variable ps, the dot(scalar) product of v1 and v2 (v1 and v2 are vectors of IR)
Write an algorithm which determines, for n pairs of given vectors, whether two vectors of given IR are orthogonal, by calling the procedure defined in the previous question. The dot product of two orthogonal vectors is zero.
*/



/*Second Task:
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand.

Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1.
